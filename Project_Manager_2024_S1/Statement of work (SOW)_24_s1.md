## Scope of Work

### Requirements Analysis and Project Planning

To ensure the project's success, we'll follow a structured approach to analyze requirements and plan our efforts:

1. **Requirements Analysis:**
   - Conduct comprehensive market research and technical studies to gather all necessary project requirements. This phase is critical for understanding the needs of our target audience and the technical challenges we must overcome.

2. **Project Planning:**
   - Develop a detailed project plan that includes clear milestones and delivery timelines. This plan will serve as our roadmap, ensuring that the project stays on track and meets its objectives efficiently.

### Technology Prototype Development

The development of our technology prototype involves two key steps:

1. **AI Prototype Development:**
   - Focus on developing an AI prototype that excels in natural language understanding and can seamlessly integrate into the WordPress ecosystem. This prototype will form the core of our technology, enabling users to interact with WordPress in a more intuitive way.

2. **Recommendation Algorithm:**
   - Design a basic yet effective recommendation algorithm for suggesting the most suitable WordPress plugins and themes to users. This algorithm will enhance the platform's usability by aiding users in making informed decisions.

### User Interface (UI) Design and Development

Our UI design and development process is centered around accessibility and user experience:

1. **UI Design:**
   - Create an accessible and intuitive user interface designed for a diverse range of user interactions. Our goal is to make the platform as user-friendly as possible, catering to both technical and non-technical users.

2. **Usability Testing:**
   - Perform comprehensive usability tests to identify areas for improvement in the user experience. These tests will help us refine the UI and ensure that it meets the needs of our target audience.

### Preliminary Integration Testing

Integration testing is a crucial step in validating the effectiveness of our technology:

1. **Integration of NLP Models and Algorithms:**
   - Integrate the developed NLP models and recommendation algorithms within the WordPress framework. This integration is essential for ensuring that our technology works seamlessly with WordPress.

2. **Initial Testing Phases:**
   - Conduct initial testing phases to validate the system's functionality and the user workflow. These tests will allow us to identify and address any issues early in the development process.

### Documentation and Progress Reports

Maintaining clear and comprehensive documentation is vital for both the development team and end-users:

1. **Technical Documentation and User Manuals:**
   - Develop extensive technical documentation and user manuals. These documents will guide end-users through using the platform and help them understand its features.

2. **Progress Reports:**
   - Generate periodic progress reports that detail the project's achievements and outline future plans. These reports will keep stakeholders informed about the project's status and upcoming milestones.

## Overall Project Framework

For a comprehensive understanding of how our project is structured, please refer to the visual diagram provided. The architecture is designed for optimal performance, scalability, and integration of advanced AI processing. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

1. **WordPress Platform Integration:**
   - The core WordPress platform communicates with a browser interface through the REST API. This connection facilitates the seamless exchange of data and commands between the user's browser and WordPress.

2. **NGINX as Reverse Proxy:**
   - NGINX is employed as a reverse proxy. It directs incoming requests to the appropriate server, in this case, our AWS server. This setup enhances security and load balancing, ensuring efficient handling of web traffic.
