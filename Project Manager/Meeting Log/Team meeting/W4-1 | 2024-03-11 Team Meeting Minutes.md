## Action items 
- @Stephanie requires to complete the competitor analys, including:
   - Difference between Google site and AI-enhanced wordpress 
   - User scenario of choosing AI-enhanced 
- With vue, react, python, @Nicky would need to approach these three options and finalise for the front-end team to use 
- Allocate all the requirements from member and user-stoy, and front-end team would have a discussion about the feasilability of each feature 
- Which


- Back-end team would require to finish the rest implementation of basic infrastructure 
    - POST request methodology to handle the data parsing 
    - Integrate AWS server to ensure its properly connected to both front-end and back-end 
    - Upload text utilise API 

 
- @Stephanie is tasked with completing the competitor analysis, which includes:
   - Highlighting differences between Google Site and AI-enhanced WordPress.
