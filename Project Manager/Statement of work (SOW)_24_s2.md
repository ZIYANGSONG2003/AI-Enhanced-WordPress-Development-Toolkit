# Statement of Work (SoW)

## Project Title: AI-Enhanced WordPress Development Toolkit
**Prepared By:** Enhanced Team

**Date Prepared:** 31/07/2024

**Project Start Date:** 19/02/2024

## Executive Summary
The AI-Enhanced WordPress Development Toolkit aims to transform the landscape of web development through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Here's how the project sets itself apart:

### AI Integration:
- **Core Technology:** We utilize the hook detachability of WordPress plugins and enable AI to automatically generate shortcodes (shortcode, a method in WordPress that allows users to utilize functions defined in plugins directly on their website). 

### User Experience:
- **Addressing Past AI Website Generation Issues:** Past issues with AI-generated websites include the inability of AI to complete tasks involving multiple files or lengthy code and layouts, often resulting in formatting errors. Now, by allowing AI to generate shortcodes, and then saving these shortcodes into a WordPress-created database, users can directly see each shortcode generated by AI in the management interface and use them to assemble their websites.

### AI-Driven Features:
- **Training AI Capabilities:** We plan to train the AI so that it can understand what components and shortcodes are needed to assemble different types of websites (we will pre-write some well-formed shortcodes into the database to provide more options and references). 
- **Automated Generation and Layout:** Users can initially inform the AI of the type and functionality of the website they want, and the AI can automatically generate and layout the site (with the user possibly needing to finalize the layout, but this is straightforward within WordPress).

## Background
The project stands on a robust foundation of innovation, distinguished by several key achievements:

### Company Registration and Positioning:
- Early on, the project solidified its identity through company registration and clear positioning, ensuring a strong, recognizable brand that aligns with its strategic goals and market aspirations.

  - The experience of the project's founder Ziyang Song contributes to the strategic vision of the project.

## Project Purpose
The main goal of the Toolkit is to make web development accessible to a wider audience by breaking down the traditional barriers associated with website creation. It aims to achieve this through several key features:

### Natural Language Processing:
- Enables users to select plugins and components through simple, natural language commands. This innovation makes it easier for users to navigate and utilize the Toolkit's offerings without needing in-depth technical knowledge.

### User-Friendly Interface:
- The design of the Toolkit prioritizes ease of use, ensuring that individuals without technical backgrounds can navigate and operate the platform effectively. This approach aims to broaden the scope of who can engage in web development.

### Open Platform for Creativity:
- By removing the complexities of coding, the Toolkit opens up a world of creativity and customization. Users can bring their unique visions to life without the constraints that typically accompany web development, fostering a more inclusive and innovative digital landscape.

## Scope of Work

### Requirements Analysis and Project Planning
To ensure the project's success, we'll follow a structured approach to analyze requirements and plan our efforts:

#### Requirements Analysis:
- Conduct comprehensive market research and technical studies to gather all necessary project requirements. This phase is critical for understanding the needs of our target audience and the technical challenges we must overcome.

#### Project Planning:
- Develop a detailed project plan that includes clear milestones and delivery timelines. This plan will serve as our roadmap, ensuring that the project stays on track and meets its objectives efficiently.

### Technology Prototype Development
The development of our technology prototype involves two key steps:

#### AI Prototype Development:
- Focus on developing an AI prototype that excels in natural language understanding and can seamlessly integrate into the WordPress ecosystem. This prototype will form the core of our technology, enabling users to interact with WordPress in a more intuitive way.

#### Recommendation Algorithm:
- Design a basic yet effective recommendation algorithm for suggesting the most suitable WordPress plugins and themes to users. This algorithm will enhance the platform's usability by aiding users in making informed decisions.

### User Interface (UI) Design and Development
Our UI design and development process is centered around accessibility and user experience:

#### UI Design:
- Create an accessible and intuitive user interface designed for a diverse range of user interactions. Our goal is to make the platform as user-friendly as possible, catering to both technical and non-technical users.

#### Usability Testing:
- Perform comprehensive usability tests to identify areas for improvement in the user experience. These tests will help us refine the UI and ensure that it meets the needs of our target audience.

### Preliminary Integration Testing
Integration testing is a crucial step in validating the effectiveness of our technology:

#### Integration of NLP Models and Algorithms:
- Integrate the developed NLP models and recommendation algorithms within the WordPress framework. This integration is essential for ensuring that our technology works seamlessly with WordPress.

#### Initial Testing Phases:
- Conduct initial testing phases to validate the system's functionality and the user workflow. These tests will allow us to identify and address any issues early in the development process.

### Documentation and Progress Reports
Maintaining clear and comprehensive documentation is vital for both the development team and end-users:

#### Technical Documentation and User Manuals:
- Develop extensive technical documentation and user manuals. These documents will guide end-users through using the platform and help them understand its features.

#### Progress Reports:
- Generate periodic progress reports that detail the project's achievements and outline future plans. These reports will keep stakeholders informed about the project's status and upcoming milestones.

## Overall Project Framework
For a comprehensive understanding of how our project is structured, please refer to the visual diagram provided. The architecture is designed for optimal performance, scalability, and integration of advanced AI processing. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

### WordPress Platform Integration:
- The core WordPress platform communicates with a browser interface through the REST API. This connection facilitates the seamless exchange of data and commands between the user's browser and WordPress.

### NGINX as Reverse Proxy:
- NGINX is employed as a reverse proxy. It directs incoming requests to the appropriate server, in this case, our AWS server. This setup enhances security and load balancing, ensuring efficient handling of web traffic.

### AWS Server Hosting and React Frontend:
- Our server infrastructure is hosted on AWS, known for its reliability and scalability. The AWS server hosts:
  - The React frontend, which provides a dynamic and responsive user interface. It includes a Fetch function for dynamic data retrieval, enabling real-time updates and interactions within the web application.

### Backend Management and AI Processing:
- Flask, in combination with Gunicorn, is responsible for managing backend operations. This setup ensures that server-side tasks are handled efficiently and securely.
- For AI processing, our backend connects to OpenAI services. This integration allows us to leverage cutting-edge AI capabilities, including natural language processing and machine learning, to enhance our application’s functionality and user experience.

## Deliverables
Our project is structured around delivering key components and resources that will ensure the success and usability of the AI-powered WordPress Toolkit. With a project timeline from February 19, 2024, to May 17, 2024, our objectives are laid out as follows:
