# Engineer Log Entry

## Date/Time: 2024-03-01

### Current Work Epic
- **Develop logic for handling POST requests, including data parsing and responses**

### To-Do List
- [ ] Review the HTTP protocol for POST request standards
- [ ] Draft initial logic flow for parsing POST request data
- [ ] Implement POST data parsing mechanism
- [ ] Create unit tests for data parsing logic

### Learnings/Workings
- Realized the importance of robust error handling in data parsing to prevent injection attacks
- Learned about new JSON parsing libraries that offer enhanced security features

### Technical Step-Throughs
- Set up a local development environment to test POST request handling
- Successfully parsed JSON payload from POST request using `json-parser` library

### Personal Notes/Workings from Meetings
- Team agrees on using `response-handler` module for generating standardized responses
- Decisions made on response status codes for various scenarios (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request)

### Log Entry Details
- The log entry will be valid for 2-3 days as I iterate over the POST request handling logic.
- Interesting finding: optimizing the parsing algorithm can significantly reduce server response time.

### Additional Notes
- Following GTD methodology to keep track of tasks and ensure nothing slips through.
- Encountered a challenge with handling multipart/form-data; researching best practices.

### Documentation
- Began drafting internal documentation for the POST request handling process.
- Screenshots and code snippets are being compiled for the technical documentation.

### Venting/Reflection (Private)
- Frustration with legacy code integration. Planned a strategy to refactor safely without breaking changes.
