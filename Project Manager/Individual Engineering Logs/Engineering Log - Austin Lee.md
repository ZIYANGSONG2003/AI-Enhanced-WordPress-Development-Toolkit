### Personal Notes/Workings from Meetings
- Team agrees on using `response-handler` module for generating standardized responses
- Decisions made on response status codes for various scenarios (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request)

### Log Entry Details
- The log entry will be valid for 2-3 days as I iterate over the POST request handling logic.
- Interesting finding: optimizing the parsing algorithm can significantly reduce server response time.

### Additional Notes
- Following GTD methodology to keep track of tasks and ensure nothing slips through.
- Encountered a challenge with handling multipart/form-data; researching best practices.

### Documentation
- Began drafting internal documentation for the POST request handling process.
- Screenshots and code snippets are being compiled for the technical documentation.

### Venting/Reflection (Private)
- Frustration with legacy code integration. Planned a strategy to refactor safely without breaking changes.
