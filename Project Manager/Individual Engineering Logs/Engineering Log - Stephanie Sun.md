## Engineering log 1 (26/02/2024)
Date: 26/02/2024

Time: 19:00 - 21:00 

### Progress and Outcomes: 

#### R1.1 AI plugin selection research 
After discussion with Austin, we decide to use WordPress plug-ins, as it have been captured through the fetch function, and commonly used plug-ins can also be captured, but this function will be used in the AI part later, so it will not be used for the time being.

#### R1.2 NLP use case analysis 
Identify and analyse specific use cases of natural language processing (NLP) in website development, including content generation and search engine optimisation. After research, I figured that NLP technology has significant potential in website development, effectively improving content generation efficiency, website ranking, and user experience. However, there are also challenges that require careful application and continuous strategy optimization. Thus, during team meeting, I would mentio how can we combine NLP with human review to ensure content quality and we should focus on user experience, avoid over-optimization, and continuously learn new technologies to maintain a competitive edge.

### Issues Encountered:

Experienced ethical considerations with the use of NLP, as it raises concerns regarding potential biases and privacy issues inherent in the algorithms and data sources utilized. These considerations involve examining the fairness and inclusivity of NLP models, as well as safeguarding user privacy and ensuring data protection measures are in place.

### Next Steps:
Discuss the current research with the rest team and during team meeting distribute new task

### Progress and Outcomes: 
#### G1.1 Initiate the Project /Onboarding
- Record weekly meeting and upload the document to Confluence as the meeting minutes
  - Prepare Agenda: Compile a list of agenda items to be discussed during the general weekly meeting.
Ensure the agenda items cover key topics, updates, and any action items from previous meetings.
  - Send Agenda to Members: Distribute the agenda to each meeting attendee in advance. Send the agenda in Wechat group
  - During the Meeting: As the meeting progresses, document discussions, decisions, and action items. Record the meeting minutes in a structured format, following the agenda items.  
  - Record Attendance: Note the names of attendees present at the meeting. Include any late arrivals or early departures.
  - Discussion Points: Summarize discussions for each agenda item. Capture key points, decisions made, and any action items assigned.Use clear and concise language to record discussions.
  - Action Items: List tasks assigned during the meeting. Specify responsible parties and deadlines for completion. Include any follow-up actions required.

- Update Statement of Work
  - Formatting the Current Work
    - Review the existing SOW document to assess its current formatting.
    - Ensure consistency in font styles, sizes, and formatting elements (e.g., headings, bullet points, numbering).
  - Formatting the Current Work

- Checking Grammar and Outlining
    - Verify the accuracy of all information provided in the SOW, including project scope, deliverables, timelines, and terms.
    - Ensure clarity and conciseness in the language used throughout the document.
- Styling SOW
    - Enhance the visual appeal of the SOW document by incorporating relevant design elements.
    - Use headers, subheaders, and bullet points to break up large blocks of text and improve readability.
    - Consider using tables, graphs, or charts to present complex information in a more visually appealing format.

- Work on the powerpoint of Audit 1
  - Gather Content
      - Collect all relevant information, data, and findings from Audit 1.
      - Review meeting minutes, decision logs, and team role table ensure we have comprehensive content.
  - Outline Presentation Structure: Determine the structure and flow of your PowerPoint
  - Review the work Austin completed and Edit
     - Ensure that the content is concise, accurate, and aligned with the objectives of Audit 1.
     - Make final adjustments or refinements to the presentation based on feedback and practice sessions.

### Issues Encountered:
- Inconsistent Communication Channels:
Sending the agenda through the WeChat group may not be the most effective method for all team members, especially if some members prefer email or another platform. This could lead to confusion or missed communications.
- Alignment with Audit Objectives:
Ensuring that the content of the PowerPoint presentation aligns accurately with the objectives of Audit 1 may be challenging, particularly if there are differing interpretations or perspectives on the findings. This could necessitate careful review and alignment to avoid misrepresentation.


### Next Steps:
Prepare the speech notes for Audit 1

### Progress and Outcomes: 

#### R2.1 Stakeholder needs research
- Engaging with Stakeholders:
  - Initiate communication channels with stakeholders, including potential users and developers.
  - Conduct interviews, surveys, or focus groups to gather feedback on their requirements and expectations from the project.

- Understanding User Needs:
  -  Dive deep into understanding the specific needs, pain points, and aspirations of the target users.
  -  Identify user personas and their unique preferences to tailor the project's features and functionalities accordingly.
 
- Feedback Collection and Analysis:
  - Systematically collect feedback from stakeholders through various channels, such as surveys, feedback forms, or direct interactions.
  - Organize and analyze the collected feedback to derive actionable insights that can guide the product's development direction.
    
- User Story Enhancement:
  - Augment existing user stories with additional information gathered from stakeholder interactions.
  - Refine user stories based on the insights obtained to ensure they accurately reflect user needs and expectations.

- Documentation and Reporting:
  - Document findings, insights, and recommendations derived from stakeholder needs research in a structured format.
  - Prepare reports or presentations summarizing key findings and proposed action plans for stakeholder engagement and decision-making purposes.



#### B1.6 Define responses for unsupported request methods
- Identification of Unsupported Methods:
  - Conduct a thorough analysis of the system to identify any unsupported GET request methods.
  - Ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential scenarios where unsupported methods may be encountered.

- Definition of Response Messages:
  - Craft clear and informative response messages to be returned when unsupported GET request methods are encountered.
  - Ensure that the response messages clearly communicate the nature of the error and provide guidance on potential next steps for users.
 
- User Guidance and Support:
  - Provide clear instructions or links to relevant documentation to assist users in resolving the issue.
  - Include suggestions for alternative request methods or actions that users can take to achieve their objectives.

- Consistency and Compliance:
  - Maintain consistency in the format and structure of response messages across the system.
  - Ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices for error messaging and handling.

### Issues Encountered:

- User Frustration:
  - Unclear or unhelpful response messages may frustrate users, leading to a negative perception of the system and decreased user satisfaction.
- Difficulty in Testing:
  - Testing the effectiveness of response messages may be challenging, especially in complex or dynamic environments where multiple factors can influence error handling.
    
### Next Steps:
Show the work completed in next weekly meeting
