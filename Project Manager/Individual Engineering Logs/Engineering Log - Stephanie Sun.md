### Progress and Outcomes: 

#### R1.1 AI plugin selection research 
After discussion with Austin, we decide to use WordPress plug-ins, as it have been captured through the fetch function, and commonly used plug-ins can also be captured, but this function will be used in the AI part later, so it will not be used for the time being.

#### R1.2 NLP use case analysis 
Identify and analyse specific use cases of natural language processing (NLP) in website development, including content generation and search engine optimisation. After research, I figured that NLP technology has significant potential in website development, effectively improving content generation efficiency, website ranking, and user experience. However, there are also challenges that require careful application and continuous strategy optimization. Thus, during team meeting, I would mentio how can we combine NLP with human review to ensure content quality and we should focus on user experience, avoid over-optimization, and continuously learn new technologies to maintain a competitive edge.

### Issues Encountered:

Experienced ethical considerations with the use of NLP, as it raises concerns regarding potential biases and privacy issues inherent in the algorithms and data sources utilized. These considerations involve examining the fairness and inclusivity of NLP models, as well as safeguarding user privacy and ensuring data protection measures are in place.

### Next Steps:
Discuss the current research with the rest team and during team meeting distribute new task
