# Engineering Log - ZIYANG SONG

## Overview

This log captures the detailed progress on various tasks assigned to me in the project. It reflects the work completed, in progress, and planned, along with learnings and future goals. This document serves to track contributions and provide a transparent account of the developments and challenges encountered.

## Contributions Update

### Tasks Completed:

**G1.1 Initiate the Project Repo/Onboarding - 2451 #3**
- Successfully set up the project repository and onboarded new team members, ensuring everyone was familiar with our workflow and tools.

**B1.5 Error handling and message validation #10**
- Implemented robust error handling mechanisms for our messaging feature and validated input to prevent potential security issues.

**F1.5 Message sending function #16**
- Developed the core functionality for sending messages within our application, focusing on efficiency and user experience.

**R1.6 Front-end framework comparison #25**
- Conducted a comprehensive comparison of front-end frameworks, ultimately contributing to the decision to use React for our project due to its component-based architecture and vibrant ecosystem.

**B1.3 Develop text upload API #9**
- Created an API for text file uploads, optimizing for different file types and sizes, and integrated it with our front-end.

**F1.7 Plug-in list capture and display #23**
- Engineered a solution to capture and display a list of plug-ins, enhancing the customizability of our application.

### Ongoing Tasks:

**G1.3 Project Documentation update (Audit 2) #67**
- Currently updating and auditing project documentation to ensure accuracy and completeness.

**R2.3 Market positioning #40**
- Analyzing market trends and positioning our product to better meet customer needs and stand out in the competitive landscape.

**R1.4 User experience research #7**
- Engaging with users to gather feedback on our UI/UX, aiming to refine and improve their interactions with our platform.

### Upcoming Tasks:

**T1.1 Implement testing for database #68**
- Preparing to design and execute a comprehensive testing suite for our database to ensure data integrity and performance.

## Reflections:

- The completion of the message sending function (#F1.5) was particularly challenging due to the real-time aspects of data handling and UI responsiveness. I learned a great deal about asynchronous programming and state management in React.
- Through the front-end framework comparison (#R1.6), I gained insights into the pros and cons of various frameworks, which will be beneficial for future project decisions.

## Learnings:

- The importance of thorough testing was highlighted during the development of the text upload API (#B1.3), where edge cases had to be considered to ensure reliability.
- Collaboration and communication were key in the error handling and validation task (#B1.5), requiring cross-team efforts with the back-end team to establish consistent error codes and responses.

## Future Goals:

- For the upcoming database testing task (#T1.1), I aim to focus on learning more about automated testing frameworks and incorporating them into our CI/CD pipeline.
- I intend to take a more proactive role in mentoring new team members, sharing the knowledge and best practices I've accumulated throughout my time on the project.
