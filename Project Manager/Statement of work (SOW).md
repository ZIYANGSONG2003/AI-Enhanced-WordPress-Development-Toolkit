## Background

The project stands on a robust foundation of innovation, distinguished by several key achievements that have laid the groundwork for its development:

1. **Insights from Tencent Internship:**
   - The inception of the project's development concepts was significantly influenced by insights gained during a Tencent internship. This experience provided a deep understanding of the digital landscape, which has been instrumental in shaping the project's direction.

2. **Company Registration and Positioning:**
   - Early on, the project solidified its identity through company registration and clear positioning. This step ensured a strong, recognizable brand that aligns with its strategic goals and market aspirations.

3. **Partnership with Creatio:**
   - A strategic alliance was formed with Creatio, a renowned low-code platform. This partnership is central to the project's commitment to harnessing simplified coding solutions, making technology accessible to a broader audience and enhancing development efficiency.

4. **Team Formation:**
   - The project boasts a globally diverse team, bringing together exceptional talents, including:
     - The founder of WordPress, whose expertise in content management systems enriches the project's technological foundation.
     - The former CEO of Sohu, whose leadership experience and insights into the digital ecosystem contribute to the project's strategic vision.
   
This multidimensional background reflects the project's global ambition and its dedication to innovation, accessibility, and collaboration in the tech industry.

## Project Purpose

The Toolkit's main goal is to make web development accessible to a wider audience by breaking down the traditional barriers associated with website creation. It aims to achieve this through several key features:

1. **Natural Language Processing:**
   - Enables users to select plugins and components through simple, natural language commands. This innovation makes it easier for users to navigate and utilize the Toolkit's offerings without needing in-depth technical knowledge.

2. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - The design of the Toolkit prioritizes ease of use, ensuring that individuals without technical backgrounds can navigate and operate the platform effectively. This approach aims to broaden the scope of who can engage in web development.

3. **Open Platform for Creativity:**
   - By removing the complexities of coding, the Toolkit opens up a world of creativity and customization. Users can bring their unique visions to life without the constraints that typically accompany web development, fostering a more inclusive and innovative digital landscape.
   
## Scope of Work

### Requirements Analysis and Project Planning

To ensure the project's success, we'll follow a structured approach to analyze requirements and plan our efforts:

1. **Requirements Analysis:**
   - Conduct comprehensive market research and technical studies to gather all necessary project requirements. This phase is critical for understanding the needs of our target audience and the technical challenges we must overcome.

2. **Project Planning:**
   - Develop a detailed project plan that includes clear milestones and delivery timelines. This plan will serve as our roadmap, ensuring that the project stays on track and meets its objectives efficiently.

### Technology Prototype Development

The development of our technology prototype involves two key steps:

1. **AI Prototype Development:**
   - Focus on developing an AI prototype that excels in natural language understanding and can seamlessly integrate into the WordPress ecosystem. This prototype will form the core of our technology, enabling users to interact with WordPress in a more intuitive way.

2. **Recommendation Algorithm:**
   - Design a basic yet effective recommendation algorithm for suggesting the most suitable WordPress plugins and themes to users. This algorithm will enhance the platform's usability by aiding users in making informed decisions.

### User Interface (UI) Design and Development

Our UI design and development process is centered around accessibility and user experience:

1. **UI Design:**
   - Create an accessible and intuitive user interface designed for a diverse range of user interactions. Our goal is to make the platform as user-friendly as possible, catering to both technical and non-technical users.

2. **Usability Testing:**
   - Perform comprehensive usability tests to identify areas for improvement in the user experience. These tests will help us refine the UI and ensure that it meets the needs of our target audience.

### Preliminary Integration Testing

Integration testing is a crucial step in validating the effectiveness of our technology:

1. **Integration of NLP Models and Algorithms:**
   - Integrate the developed NLP models and recommendation algorithms within the WordPress framework. This integration is essential for ensuring that our technology works seamlessly with WordPress.

2. **Initial Testing Phases:**
   - Conduct initial testing phases to validate the system's functionality and the user workflow. These tests will allow us to identify and address any issues early in the development process.

### Documentation and Progress Reports

Maintaining clear and comprehensive documentation is vital for both the development team and end-users:

1. **Technical Documentation and User Manuals:**
   - Develop extensive technical documentation and user manuals. These documents will guide end-users through using the platform and help them understand its features.

2. **Progress Reports:**
   - Generate periodic progress reports that detail the project's achievements and outline future plans. These reports will keep stakeholders informed about the project's status and upcoming milestones.

## Overall Project Framework

Refer to the attached diagram for a visual representation of the overall project architecture:

- WordPress platform connects via REST API to a browser interface.
- NGINX serves as the reverse proxy, directing requests to the AWS server.
- The AWS server hosts the React frontend, which includes a Fetch function for dynamic data retrieval.
- Flask, coupled with Gunicorn, manages backend operations and connects to OpenAI services for AI processing.

## Deliverables

1. A functional AI-powered WordPress Toolkit prototype.
2. User guides and technical documentation.
3. Internal testing and progress reports.

## Acceptance Criteria

Successful integration of AI capabilities within the WordPress platform, a user-friendly interface, and positive feedback from initial user testing will constitute acceptance of the deliverables.
