## Executive Summary

The AI-Enhanced WordPress Development Toolkit aims to revolutionize web development by harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). By integrating advanced AI technologies such as natural language processing, the project endeavors to provide a seamless and intuitive platform for users to select and configure WordPress plugins and components, irrespective of their technical background. The Toolkit simplifies app creation and offers AI-driven customization, automated processes, and intelligent recommendations, thereby enhancing the efficiency and creativity of the web development process.

## Background

With a legacy of innovation, the project builds on the following achievements:

- Insights from a **Tencent Internship** have been crucial in shaping initial development concepts.
- **Company Registration and Positioning** established a clear company identity.
- A partnership with a **Low-code Platform** (Creatio) has been formed to leverage the benefits of simplified coding solutions.
- **Team Formation** has brought together international talent, including the founder of WordPress and the former CEO of Sohu, reflecting the global ambition of the project.

## Project Purpose

The Toolkit is designed to democratize the web development process by enabling:

- Effortless plugin and component selection via natural language.
- A user-friendly interface that accommodates non-technical users.
- An open platform for creativity and customization without the traditional barriers of coding.

## Scope of Work

### Requirements Analysis and Project Planning

- Perform an exhaustive analysis of project requirements, including market research and technical studies.
- Establish a detailed project plan with clear milestones and delivery timelines.

### Technology Prototype Development

- Develop an AI prototype focused on natural language understanding and integration into the WordPress ecosystem.
- Craft a basic recommendation algorithm for selecting the most suitable WordPress plugins and themes.

### User Interface (UI) Design and Development

- Create an accessible and intuitive UI tailored for diverse user interaction.
- Execute comprehensive usability tests to refine the user experience.

### Preliminary Integration Testing

- Integrate NLP models and recommendation algorithms within the WordPress framework.
- Conduct initial testing phases to validate system functionality and user workflow.

### Documentation and Progress Reports

- Develop extensive technical documentation and user manuals to guide end-users.
- Generate periodic progress reports detailing achievements and outlining future plans.

## Overall Project Framework

Refer to the attached diagram for a visual representation of the overall project architecture:

- WordPress platform connects via REST API to a browser interface.
- NGINX serves as the reverse proxy, directing requests to the AWS server.
- The AWS server hosts the React frontend, which includes a Fetch function for dynamic data retrieval.
- Flask, coupled with Gunicorn, manages backend operations and connects to OpenAI services for AI processing.

## Deliverables

1. A functional AI-powered WordPress Toolkit prototype.
2. User guides and technical documentation.
3. Internal testing and progress reports.

## Acceptance Criteria

Successful integration of AI capabilities within the WordPress platform, a user-friendly interface, and positive feedback from initial user testing will constitute acceptance of the deliverables.
