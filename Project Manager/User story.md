# User story 
 User stories help capture specific requirements from the end user's perspective and written in simple, non-technical language, making them accessible to all stakeholders, including clients, developers, and managers.

 
## User
- As a user, I want to tell the AI to add specific elements like text, images, or videos, and have it place them where I describe, allowing me to easily populate my site with content.
- As a user, I want to describe the layout I envision in natural language, and have the AI interpret and create the web page layout accordingly, so that I can build websites without needing to understand web design or coding.
- As a user, I want to be able to instruct the AI to modify elements, such as changing colours or resizing images, through simple text commands, making the process intuitive and efficient.As a user, I want to use an AI-Enhanced Toolkit to create an online marketplace, so that I can accommodate dynamic content, manage user accounts, and process transactions efficiently.
- As a user, I want to create an engaging website with the help of an AI-Enhanced Toolkit, so that we can run campaigns effectively and reach a broad audience regardless of our varying technical abilities.
-  As a user, I want to be able to see my previous chat history, so I can have a look at what I have built before. 




## Developer 
- As a developer, I want to apply specific CSS styles to buttons and input areas on our website, so that the interface is more visually appealing and user-friendly, improving the overall experience for users navigating and interacting with our site.
- As a developer, I want to create clear and informative loading indicators and error messages for our web application, so that users are kept informed about the status of their actions and can understand and navigate any issues that arise, enhancing their overall experience.
- As a developer, I want to ask the AI to analyse user behaviour on my site and suggest layout or content changes to improve user engagement, helping me optimise the site based on AI insights.


## Client 
- As a client, I want AI to review the website for accessibility compliance and suggest changes through a conversational interface, ensuring that the site is usable for people with disabilities without needing deep technical knowledge.
