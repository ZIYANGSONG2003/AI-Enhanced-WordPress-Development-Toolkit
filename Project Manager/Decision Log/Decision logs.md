## Decision-Making Process


Our project follows a structured decision-making rhythm that ensures efficient progress and clear communication across all team members. This process is pivotal in managing our features and tasks, especially in our fast-paced development environment. Here's an overview of our method:

Identify Important Features/UI Interfaces: We begin by identifying the crucial features and user interface elements that need to be developed or enhanced.

Clarify Requirements: Once we've pinpointed a feature, we delve into the specificsâ€”understanding the login and chat history requirements, and deciding which team (front-end or back-end) will take ownership of the task.

Task Allocation: For front-end development, we break down tasks further and assign them to individual team members, ensuring that each contributor has a clear understanding of their responsibilities.

Implementation: During this stage, we prioritize tackling bugs and integrating new enhancements. This is a continuous cycle of development, testing, and integration.

Record Decision Log: Every decision made is meticulously documented, ensuring that we maintain a log that captures the rationale behind each choice. This transparency aids in reflection and future decision-making.
