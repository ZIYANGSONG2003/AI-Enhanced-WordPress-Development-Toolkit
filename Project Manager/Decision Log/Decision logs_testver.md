## Decision-Making Process


Our project follows a structured decision-making rhythm that ensures efficient progress and clear communication across all team members. This process is pivotal in managing our features and tasks, especially in our fast-paced development environment. 

**Here's an example of how our project log a decision :**

1) Identify Important Features/UI Interfaces: We begin by identifying the crucial features and user interface elements that need to be developed or enhanced.

2) Clarify Requirements: Once we've pinpointed a feature, we delve into the specificsâ€”understanding the login and chat history requirements, and deciding which team (front-end or back-end) will take ownership of the task.

3) Task Allocation: For front-end development, we break down tasks further and assign them to individual team members, ensuring that each contributor has a clear understanding of their responsibilities.

4) Implementation: During this stage, we prioritize tackling bugs and integrating new enhancements. This is a continuous cycle of development, testing, and integration.

5) Record Decision Log: Every decision made is meticulously documented, ensuring that we maintain a log that captures the rationale behind each choice. This transparency aids in reflection and future decision-making.

## Decision Type 



|  Category  | Description                                        |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Major       | Decisions having a significant impact on project objectives, often require substantial resource allocation and stakeholder involvement, and are typically complex, long-term, and thoroughly documented. |
| Medium      | Decision having a moderate impact on project objectives, requiring careful consideration and planning but not as extensive as major decisions. These decisions often necessitate a balanced allocation of resources and may involve stakeholder consultation to ensure alignment with project goals.        |
| Minor      | Decisions typically involving small-scale, routine tasks with limited impact on project goals and can be made quickly and informally by individual team members. |

| 10 | Team     | Major     | Audit 1 Reflects  | Due to lack of clarity and familiarity with the audit process, particularly for members encountering it for the first time, there are uncertainties regarding what needs to be included in each section, the requirements for reflection and decision logs, and the absence of clear criteria for preparation. Most members are currently navigating the process of preparing for the audit.	| It is proposed that during the tutorial sessions in weeks 4 and 5, an agenda should be circulated to the tutor beforehand, outlining discussion topics, queries for Audit 2, and frequently ask feedback from the tutor to ensure the group is proceeding in the correct direction. Additionally, the feedback received should be deliberated upon during team meetings to ensure all members are aligned.	 | 11/03/2024 | Done | Team | 
| 11 | Kunlun | Major | First-time Bug discovery | While implementing the UI interface, several bugs have been encountered, including issues with React's handling of container elements, description adjustment, and plugin list persistence. Due to the complexity of these issues and lack of prior experience, it is crucial to openly discuss them. Kunlun provided a brief explanation of each bug and seek assistance from other team members to resolve them.	| Stephanie and Ziyang will assist the front-end team in resolving the bugs by demonstrating the actual resolution and providing ideas. Going forward, if any member spends too much time trying to resolve a bug, they should seek help from other team members rather than continuing to struggle alone. | 14/03/2024 | Done | Stephanie | 
| 12 | Team    | Medium | Utilise Ticketing system for project management | Currently, there is a lack of project management tools to track individual tasks and project progress, resulting in a deficiency of evidence for stakeholders. During a tutorial session, our tutor, Elena, suggested utilizing the GitHub Project feature.| We have decided to adopt the GitHub Project tool for project management. Tasks will be tracked by opening issues with descriptions and acceptance criteria assigned to relevant members. Additionally, working hours will be recorded. Once tasks are completed, they will be peer-reviewed for acceptance. If there are no further inquiries, the issue can be closed. This approach will provide us with a clear overview of our project's current stage and enable us to follow milestones to complete tasks.	| 15/03/2024 | Done | Team 
| 13| Austin & Stephanie | Medium |  Issues countered of training AI model for connect front-end and back-end | After researching articles to understand the process of training AI models, Austin and Stephanie identified several challenges, including model architecture complexity, dataset size, and optimization techniques. These challenges require significant time for the back-end team to prepare and learn how to train the model and allocate data. Consequently, Austin and Stephanie raised this issue during a team meeting and convinced the members to allocate more time to explore alternative methods for connecting the front-end and back-end.	| All team members agreed to explore alternative methods. Ziyang proposed utilizing the current AI chatbot's API to meet project requirements. Further research will be conducted to assess the feasibility of this approach by examining existing AI chatbots and understanding how their APIs can facilitate integration between the front-end and back-end.	|18/03/2024 | Done | Team |  
| 14 | Tutor    | Minor | Elevator Pitch Script | Although inclusion of the elevator pitch was on the tutorial agenda, it was not assigned to a specific member, resulting in no prepared member during the tutorial.	| The elevator pitch will be assigned to a particular member, and they will be reminded during each tutorial and audit session that we will begin with a 1-minute elevator pitch introducing the project, its goals, and a comparison with Google sites | 22/03/2024 | Done | Ziyang | 
| 15 | Shadow Team  | Medium  | Copyright and Ethical Issues in AI Utilization	 |During the Q&A session with the shadow team, concerns were raised regarding the legal and ethical aspects of using AI models, given the widespread use of AI.	 | While ethical issues related to AI were initially acknowledged, they were not given due consideration during implementation. Therefore, it has been decided to open an issue and assign it to Stephanie for in-depth research on copyright laws and ethical considerations pertaining to AI usage. This research is essential to ensure successful implementation aligned with project objectives.	| 26/03/2024 | Todo | Team
