## Relevant Data

After presenting the complete version of our video showcase to tutor Elena, feedback was received highlighting issues with the scope of the video. Based on her recommendations, we have decided to make specific enhancements focusing on detailed team introductions and backend technology explanations.

## Background

The objective of the video was to accurately represent our AI-enhanced project's scope and team capabilities. Elena’s feedback has provided us with a clear direction to improve our presentation by offering a deeper insight into our team's expertise and the technologies we utilize.

## Feedback from Tutor Elena

Elena pointed out that the video did not adequately detail the scope of the project, particularly the depth of the team's expertise and the technical specifics of the backend development.

## Decisions for Scope Adjustment

1. **AI-Enhanced Project Team Introduction**:
    - Frontend team: Highlight their education and experience, including courses like HTML (COMP1710/6780) and Python (COMP7230), along with their in-depth research contributions.
    - Backend team:
        - Part 1: Discuss the AI components developed under the guidance of Prof. Liang Zheng and inspired by techniques from AI coder Devin.
        - Part 2: Explain the decision to implement functionalities via a Wordpress plugin, focusing on AI and NLP technologies, particularly integrating the ChatGPT4 API for advanced natural language processing.

## Implementation Process

1. **Content Revision**: Redraft the script to include detailed sections on both the frontend and backend teams, emphasizing their qualifications, experiences, and specific contributions to the project.
2. **Visual Enhancement**: Update the storyboard to incorporate visuals that better illustrate the team’s expertise and technical diagrams that explain the backend architecture.
3. **Re-filming**: Shoot new segments where necessary to reflect the updated content, ensuring a coherent flow and maintaining viewer engagement.
4. **Feedback and Iteration**: Share the revised video with tutor Elena and select stakeholders for additional feedback and further refine the presentation as needed.
5. **Final Approval and Launch**: Obtain final approval from Tutor Elena and prepare the enhanced video for public viewing.

## Standard Procedure for Future Scope Adjustments

1. **Clear Definition of Scope**: Ensure all video showcases begin with a clear and comprehensive definition of scope.
2. **Regular Feedback Loops**: Incorporate feedback at various stages of content creation to align with audience expectations and project goals.
3. **Detailed Team Introductions**: Always include detailed introductions of team members to highlight expertise and build credibility.
4. **Technical Details Presentation**: Ensure technical aspects are clearly explained to convey the sophistication and capability of the project.
5. **Post-Release Reviews**: After release, conduct reviews to gather audience reactions and identify areas for improvement in future showcases.

## Outcome

The adjustments to the video showcase are expected to enhance its accuracy in depicting our project's scope and the expertise of our team. This revision process, guided by the insights from Tutor Elena, will serve as a valuable template for enhancing the clarity and effectiveness of future presentations.
